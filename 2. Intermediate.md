## Lexical This

- Other than arrow and bound functions, `this` is driven by the calling context.
- Functions in Javascript are `first class`, meaning that they can be stored in a variable.
- Instead of simple method, can create property pointing to an arrow function, to provide lexically scoped `this`.
  - Since all properties initialise and execute at the end of the constructor, `this` will be bound to whatever instance is present within the constructor.

## Readonly modifier

- `const` declaration does not prevent us from assigning different values to the members of the variable.
- Typescript allows adding `readonly` modifier to differnt members of type, to prevent re-assigning of values.
- `readonly` is compile-time support only for error checking and does not use any run-time Javascript support.

## Union Types

- If you want to allow multiple types to, for example, function parameter, you can use `union types`.
- `Union types` are simply multiple types separated by `|` operator.
- Can extract union type to its own type alias to provide well-defined name for code-readability.

## Literal Types

- Typescript allows using any string literal in a type position. Then, only value that can be assigned to that variable is the string literal. This is called `literal types`.
- Commonly used as a union of literal types. And can provide type alias to it.
- Also support literal type for boolean and number values.

## Type Narrowing

- Typescript can narrow down the type under the block that is under `if typeof` condition. But if not primitive type, `typeof` returns string like `'object'` so cannot be used to differentiate.
- Instead one can use `instanceof` to differentiate between different classes.
- For objects not created by constructor, can check for property of the object using `in`.

## Discriminated Unions

- By providing a property that has different literal types to types in same union type, one can differentiate them easily and typescript can narrow down the type.

## Class Parameter Properties

- In typescript, one can simply pass modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected` or `readonly` in constructor parameters, to declare the properties and initialise them with the values passed, when creating class instances.

## Strict Compiler Option

- Under `strict = true` in the compiler option:
  - If you don't specify type annotations for something typescript cannot infer, it gives compile-time error.
  - Ensures class properties are initialised in the constructor so that they have a value of defined type at all time.
  - Checks for the possibility of the variable being `undefined`, e.g. after `.find()` function.

## Null vs Undefined

- If something hasn't been initialised, then it is of type `undefined` and if something is currently unavailable, it is of type `null`.

## Intersection Types

- Can use `&` operator to use intersection types to inherit the properties of one type to another.

## Optional Modifier

- Can add optional member by appending `?` at the end of the member. Otherwise, all members are inferred as required.
- Optional members also have type of `undefined` as well as the defined type.

## Non-null Assertion Operator

- `!` is `non-null assertion` that tells the compiler that the particular variable will never be null.

## Interfaces

- Interfaces has `extends` keyword to achieve same thing as intersection in types.
- There are two reasons why interface exists:
  - One is for the familiarity to developers coming from another language.
  - The other is `interface declaration merging`.

## Interface Declaration Merging

- Typescript merges different properties defined under same interface name.

## Types vs Interfaces

- Interfaces don't have support to
  - Shorthand function syntax, e.g. `type InputOnChange = (newValue: Inputvalue) => void`
  - Primitive type
  - Type union

## Never Type

- Typescript infers the return type of function that can never return as `never`.
- By assigning a variable to never type, it can be used to check if all the cases are thoroughly handled.
