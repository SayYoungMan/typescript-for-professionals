# 3. Advanced

## Implements keyword

- Typescript can ensure that the instance can provide all the features required by the type using `implements` keyword.

## Definite Assignment Assertion

- You can put `!` operator when declaring a variable to tell typescript that the varaible definitely has value and this is called `definite assignment assertion`.

```typescript
let dice!: number;
```

## User Defined Type Guards

- `User defined type guards` is simply a function that returns a boolean value and it is annotated in the form `<parameter> is <type>`.
- This tells typescript that if the function returns true, then the variable is of that type.

```typescript
function isSquare(shape: Shape): shape is Square {
  return "size" in shape;
}
```

## Assertion Functions

- Typescript does not do any implicit assertion checking but it does support explicit assertion checking using `assertion functions`.
- We need to add `asserts <condition>` in the return type of the function.

```typescript
function assert(condition: unknown, message: string): asserts condition {
  if (!condition) throw new Error(message);
}
```

- Use `user defined type guards` for application code and `assertion functions` for application tests.

## Function Overloading

- We can define the return type of the function for a given input type using `function overloading`.
- Can declare multiple signatures for any given function before the function body.

```typescript
function reverse(string: string): string;
function reverse(stringArray: string[]): string[];
function reverse(stringOrStringArray: string | string[]) {
  // implementation
}
```

- You can use `function overloading` to shadow internal function signature and force the ways to invoke the function.

## Call Signatures

- One can declare the type for function using `call signature`. Call signature can be called with multiple `constructor overloads`, `function overloads` and property.

```typescript
type PointCreator = {
  // Constructor overloads
  new (x: number, y: number): { x: number; y: number };
  new (x: number, y: number, z: number): { x: number; y: number; z: number };

  // Function overloads
  (x: number, y: number): { x: number; y: number };
  (x: number, y: number, z: number): { x: number; y: number; z: number };

  // Properties
  debugName: string;
};
```

## Abstract Classes

- A class can be marked as `abstract` using `abstract` keyword and you can provide abstract members.
- `Abstract` members do not have any implementations and the main objective is to be inherited and for child classes to provide implementations.
- Mainly used by classes that want to be `extended`.
- You cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

```typescript
abstract class Command {
  abstract commandLine(): string;

  execute() {
    console.log("Executing:", this.commandLine());
  }
}

class GitResetCommand extends Command {
  commandLine() {
    return "git reset --hard";
  }
}
```

## Index Signatures

- You can force the type for keys and values of an object using `index signatures`.
- Also, one can mark the particular member of object required by putting well-defined members.

```typescript
type PersonDictionary = {
  [username: string]: Person;
  jane: Person;
};
```

## Readonly Arrays and Tuples

- `readonly` keyword in Typescript can prevent performing in-place operations on arrays and tuples, such as `sort()` or `reverse()`.

```typescript
// Array example
function reverseSorted(input: readonly number[]): number[] {
  return input.slice().sort().reverse();
  // Will show compile-time error without slice()
}

type Neat = readonly number[];
type Long = ReadonlyArray<number>;

// Tuple example
type Point = readonly [number, number];

function move(point: Point, x: number, y: number): Point {
  return [point[0] + x, point[1] + y];
}
```

## Double Assertion

- `Type Assertion` would fail if two types does not share any common properties.
- However, using `double assertion` with `unknown`, you can ignore compiler errors.
- Should avoid this at all times but might help migrate some javascript codes.

```typescript
type Point3D = { x: number; y: number; z: number };
type Person = { name: string; email: string };

point3 = person as unknown as Point3D;
```

## Const Assertion

- `Const assertion` is essentially hint to the type inference that you wanted to infer the most immutable type possible.
- It converts any `primitive types` to `literal types`, any members of an object to `readonly` members and any arrays to `readonly` tuples.
- It is recommended to apply `const assertion` to the most required specifics as possible.

## This Parameter

- You can provide `this parameter` to the function to only be called on classes that have a particular property.
- `This parameter` must be the first parameter of the function because it is not an actual parameter so it is only used during compile-time checking.

```typescript
function double(this: { value: number }) {
  this.value = this.value * 2;
}
```

## Generic Constraints

- You can use `generic constraints` to enforce that the type parameter passed need to have certain properties.

```typescript
type NameFields = { firstName: string; lastName: string };

function addFullName<T extends NameFields>(obj: T): T & { fullName: string } {
  return {
    ...obj,
    fullName: `${obj.firstName} ${obj.lastName}`,
  };
}
```

## Dealing with Temporal Uncertainty

- When you are using `callback`, any of the tests you might have done outside the `callback` are essentially discarded because typescript doesn't know when the `callback` will execute.
- You can save the value after the type check in a new variable.
