# 1. Basics

## Set up

- `npm i typescript` to install typescript compiler to the project.
- `npx tsc --init --rootdir src --outdir lib` - `npx tsc` to use the tsc bundled with the version of typescript.
- `--init` to initialise new `tsconfig.json` that stores all typescript config.
- `--rootdir` to locate the source code and `--outdir` to inidicate output code location.
- Typescript files cannot be run by nodeJS but needs to be compiled into javascript by `npx tsc --watch`.

## Primitive Types

- `boolean` can hold either true or false.
- `number` can hold any floating 64-bit value.
- `string` can hold any number of characters.
- `undefined` indicates the value is not yet defined.
- `null` indicates the value is not present.
- `symbol` is used to create globally unique identifiers.
- `bigint` to hold arbitrarily large whole numbers.
- These primitive types are written in lower case in Typescript.

## Instance Types

- There are in-built classes such as `RegExp`, `Array` and `Set`.
- We annotate instances of these like `Array<number>`.

## Arrays and Tuples

- We can annotate Arrays using square brackets e.g. `number[]`
- Fixed length arrays are called `tuples` and initialised as `[number, number]` for two element tuple.

## Object Types and Type Aliases

- Typescript allows us to define and reuse types using `type aliases`.
- e.g.

```typescript
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
```

- It allows us to name our intent and remove code duplication.

## Const declarations

- One cannot re-declare a value assigned to `const`.
- However, all other behaviours such as modifying the properties of an object is allowed like `let`.

## Functions

- Can annotate type of parameters and returns of function.
- If function does not return anything, we can annotate `void`.
- To make function take indefinite number of arguments, use `...` in front of a parameter. (`rest parameter`)
- Javascript supports `first class functions` meaning we can store functions in variable.
- Thus, we can make type aliase for function as well, e.g.

```typescript
type Add = (a: number, b: number) => number;
```

## Structural Typing

- Typescript has `structural typing` meaning that it is agnostic to the name of types but only cares about the structure.
- It is possible to assign variable that has more structures to the one that has less as long as it contains all that is required. (`duck typing`) e.g.

```typescript
type Point2D = { x: number; y: number };
type Point3D = { x: number; y: number; z: number };

let p2d: Point2D = { x: 0, y: 10 };
let p3d: Point3D = { x: 0, y: 10, z: 20 };

p2d = p3d; // OK
function takesPoint2D(point: Point2D) {}
takesPoint2D(p3d); // OK
```

## Classes

- Typescript allows all class methods and properties to be annotated with type.
- Typescript provides additional access modifier called `protected`, which keeps member inaccessible from the instances but children classes can access it.

## Target Compiler Option

- One can specify ECMAScript version in `tsconfig.json` and typescript compiler will generate the code accordingly. Some modern features can be transpiled in older versions but some may not.

## Generics

- `Generics` allow to add type arguments that can be used to enforce relationship between different members of piece of code.
- e.g.

```typescript
class Queue<T> {
  data = [];
  push(item: T) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }
  pop(): T {
    return this.data.shift();
  }
}
```

## Any and Unknown

- Both are `universal super types` in typescript, meaning any types can be assigned to those.
- `Any` gives complete freedom to have any value to the variable.
- `Unknown` is a safer type since it needs to check the type of it first before calling its method or assigning.

## Javascript to Typescript

- Any unannotated variables in typescript will have a type `any`.
- When refactoring legacy Javascript code, using `unknown` type can be handy to check the type at runtime and prevent any runtime errors.

## Type Assertions

- Typescript provides `type assertions` to tell the compiler the type of variable without any type inference or type checks.
- You can simple append `as type` at the end of variable or `<type>` in front. But latter is not recommended as it does not work in tsx file (thinks it's JSX element).

## Type Casting

- Typescript type assertion is different from type casting because it does not change the value the variable holds even if the type changes.
- To cast type, you need to use Javascript type casting.

## Type Declarations

- One can declare type of a variable but cannot provide any implementation details.
- Can be declared in separate declaration file with extension of `d.ts`.
