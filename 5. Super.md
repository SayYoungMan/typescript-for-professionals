## Partial\<T>

- Makes all properties optional

```typescript
type Point = { x: number; y: number };

// Same as { x?: number, y?: number }
type ParitalPoint = Partial<Point>;
```

## Required\<T>

- Make all properties in T required

```typescript
type PartialPoint = { x?: number; y?: number };

// Same as { x: number, y: number }
type Point = Partial<Point>;
```

## Readonly\<T>

- Make all properties in T readonly

## Record<K, V>

- Data structure that is like map provided by Typescript
- Apart from primitive types you can also use union types as the key of record
- Then, it ensures that all the keys in restricted set of keys have their values signed.
- You can simplify creating small repeated properties of object type.

## Autocomplete Literal Unions with Primitives

- In order to retain autocomplete capability when allowing both literal unions and primitives like:

```typescript
type Padding = "small" | "normal" | "large" | string;
```

- Consider changing this to:

```typescript
type Padding = "small" | "normal" | "large" | (string & {});
```

## Project References

- It allows you to work on multiple typescript projects at the same time.
- For library project, go to `tsconfig.json` file and set `"composite": true`, make `"declaration": true` and set `"rootdir"`. This makes the project ready to be referenced by other projects.
- Go to `tsconfig.json` of the other project that needs to reference it. and add

```json
"references": [
    { "path": "../example-lib/" }
]
```

- Use `--build` flag instead of `-p` flag to compile not only itself but other projects that it depends on. `--watch` flag will pick up changes in other projects as well.

## undefined vs optional

- If defined as optional property, it can both be initialised with undefined value or missing the value.
- However, if defined as union with property, it can be initialised with undefined value but not with missing value.
- **Use optional**, unless you have a specific reason to use undefined.

## Satisfies operator

- You can use `satisfies` operator to check the type of an object instead of explicitly specifying the type, so that you can get an error when there is a property that does not conform and doesn't impact on any of the type inferences.

## PropertyKey

- `PropertyKey = string | number | symbol`
- These are the primitive types that are allowed to be the key of map.

## ThisType\<T> Utility

- `ThisType<{ value: number }>` can be used to allow the type of object that has a value member with type number.
- So that one does not have to populate with `this` everywhere.

## Awaited\<T> Utility

- No matter how many promises it is wrapped with, javascript's `await` keyword will resolve all the promises.
- `Awaited<T>` brings out the final type only from the Promises.

## String Manipulation Utilities

- `Uppercase<T>` takes the string literal type and returns to upper-cased version of the literal. Likewise, `Lowercase<T>`, `Capitalize<T>` and `Uncapitalize<T>` also exists.

## Mapped Types as Clauses

- Can capitalise all the keys of a map using `as` clause in typescript.

```typescript
export type Setters<State> = {
  [K in keyof State & string as `set${Capitalize<K>}`]: (
    value: State[K]
  ) => void;
};

export type Getters<State> = {
  [K in keyof State & string as `get${Capitalize<K>}`]: () => State[K];
};
```

- Notice here that we used `State & string` to intersect string out of State as `Capitalize` is only applicable to string type.
