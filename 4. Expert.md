## `typeof` Type Operator

- Typescript provides `typeof` type operator to generate a type from any variable in the code base.
- You can generate type of JSON response as well.

```typescript
const personResponse = {
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
};

type PersonResponse = typeof personResponse;
```

## Lookup Types

- You can use `lookup type` to provide type of part of complicated type object.
- You can access the type of an item in an array as well.

```typescript
type PaymentRequest = SubmitRequest["payment"];

export function getPayment(): PaymentRequest {
  return {
    creditCardToken: "124q234n12!",
  };
}
```

## `keyof` Type Operator

- You can extract the union of key string literals of an object type using `keyof` operator.

```typescript
function logGet<Obj, Key extends typeof Obj>(obj: Obj, key: Key) {
  const value = obj[key];
  console.log("Getting:", key, value);
  return value;
}
```

## Conditional Types

- You can set the type for certain condition, using ternary operator.

```typescript
type IsNumber<T> = T extends number ? "number" : "other";
```

## Conditional Types with Unions and Never

- When a type has union type with `never`, it will not have a `never` type, as that will not be assigned.
- This property is useful to exclude some types from T.

```typescript
export type NoEmpty<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
```

## Infer Keyword and `ReturnType<T>`

- You can use `infer` keyword to infer what the type should be at specified places.

```typescript
// type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : never;
// This is given by typescript natively

type Person = ReturnType<typeof createPerson>;
```

## Mapped Types

- `Mapped types` can loop through type variables and perform operation on them.

```typescript
// This is natively supported by Typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [Item in keyof T]: T[item];
};
```

## Mapped Type Modifiers

- You can add `?` modifier or `readonly` modifier to make the members in type optional or readonly.

- You can add `+` token to add feature and `-` token to remove feature.

```typescript
// Natively provided by Typescript
export type Partial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};
```

## Template Literal Type

- With backticks, you can use `template literal strings` where you can include JavaScript expressions as part of the string.

```javascript
`Example: ${jsStringLiteral}`;
```

- In Typescript, there is a feature called `templace literal type`, which that follows the string literal format with the type of part of string.

```typescript
let templaceLiteral: `Example: ${string}`;
```
